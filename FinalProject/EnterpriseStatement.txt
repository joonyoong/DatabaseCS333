In the US Cars are crucial to our everyday life. Everybody buys or at least sells a Car
somepoint in their lives. The Car market is being constantly updated especially many cars being 
created yearly. So, I decided to create a database on Cars since there are so many cars with unique 
identifier called the VIN. This database system should ease the update on future cars and constantly 
update the price depreciation of cars.
